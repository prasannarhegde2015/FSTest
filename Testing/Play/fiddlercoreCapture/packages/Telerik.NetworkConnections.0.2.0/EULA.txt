1.10.1.2.	Exceptions.  We will not indemnify you to the extent that the alleged infringement or misappropriation results from (a) use of the Product in combination with any other software or item not supplied by us; (b) failure to promptly implement an Update provided by us pursuant to 1.10.1.3 (Our Options); (c) modification of the Product not made or provided by us; or (d) use of the Product in a manner not permitted by this EULA.

1.10.1.3.	Our Options.  If a final injunction is, or we reasonably believe that it could be, obtained against your use of the Product, or if in our opinion the Product is likely to become the subject of a successful claim of infringement, we may, at our option and expense, (a) replace or modify the Product so that it becomes non-infringing (provided that the functionality is substantially equivalent), (b) obtain for you a license to continue to use the Product, or (c) if neither (a) nor (b) are reasonably practicable, terminate this EULA on thirty (30) days' notice and, if the Product was licensed to you on a Perpetual License or Term License basis, refund to you the license fee paid to us for the Product less an amount for depreciation determined on a straight-line five year (or actual term if shorter) depreciation basis with a commencement date as of the date of delivery of the Product, or if the Product was licensed to you on a Subscription License basis, refund to you the unused portion of the fees paid in advance to us for the then-current subscription period for the Product. THE INDEMNIFICATION PROVISIONS SET OUT IN THIS SECTION 1.10.1 STATE OUR ENTIRE LIABILITY AND YOUR SOLE AND EXCLUSIVE REMEDY WITH RESPECT TO ANY INFRINGEMENT OR ALLEGED INFRINGEMENT BY US OF ANY INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY RIGHTS OR PROPRIETARY RIGHTS IN RESPECT OF THE PRODUCT OR ITS USE.
1.10.2.	Your Indemnification Obligation.
1.10.2.1.	Indemnification for Third Party-Claims.  To the extent permitted by applicable law, you will defend us and our Affiliates, and our and their respective officers, directors, employees, and agents from and against any and all third party claims, lawsuits, and proceedings that arise or result from (a) your breach of this EULA, (b) your use, distribution and/or licensing of the Redistributables, if applicable, except to the extent it arises from an IP Claim covered under section 1.10.1 above, or (c) your failure or alleged failure to comply with Applicable Laws or any violation of a third party's rights in connection with your use of the Product (each a "Third-Party Claim" and collectively "Third-Party Claims") and you will indemnify for damages finally awarded by a court of competent jurisdiction with respect to any Third-Party Claim. 
1.10.3.	Control of the Defense or Settlement. For any indemnification obligation covered in section 1.10.1,"Indemnifying Party" means us, "Indemnified Party" means you, and "Claim" means an IP Claim. For any indemnification obligation covered in section 1.10.2, "Indemnifying Party" means you, "Indemnified Party" means us, and "Claim" means a Third-Party Claim. The Indemnified Party must provide the Indemnifying Party with prompt written notice of a Claim; however, the Indemnified Party's failure to provide or delay in providing such notice will not relieve the Indemnifying Party of its obligations under this section except to the extent the Indemnifying Party is prejudiced by the Indemnified Party's failure or delay. The Indemnified Party will give the Indemnifying Party full control of the defense and settlement of the Claim as long as such settlement does not include a financial obligation on or admission of liability by the Indemnified Party. If the Indemnified Party does not do so, then the Indemnified Party waives the Indemnifying Party's indemnification obligations under section 1.10.1 or 1.10.2, as applicable. The Indemnified Party will reasonably cooperate in the defense of the Claim and may appear, at its own expense, through counsel reasonably acceptable to the Indemnifying Party.
1.11.	Confidentiality.  
1.11.1.	Confidentiality Obligations.  Except as otherwise provided herein, each party agrees to retain in confidence all information and know-how transmitted or disclosed to the other that the disclosing party has identified as being proprietary and/or confidential or should reasonably  be  understood  to  be  confidential  given  the  nature  of  the  information  and  the  circumstances surrounding its disclosure, and agrees to make no use of such information and know-how except under the terms of this EULA. However, neither party will have an obligation to maintain the confidentiality of information that (a) it received rightfully from a third party without an obligation to maintain such information in confidence; (b) was known to the receiving party prior to its disclosure by the disclosing party; (c) is or becomes a matter of public knowledge through no fault of the receiving party; or (d) is independently developed by the receiving party without use of the confidential information of the disclosing party. Further, either party may disclose confidential information of the other party as required by governmental or judicial order, provided such party gives the other party prompt written notice prior to such disclosure (unless such prior notice is not permitted by applicable law) and complies with any protective order (or equivalent) imposed on such disclosure. You will treat any source code for the Product as our confidential information and will not disclose, disseminate or distribute such materials to any third party without our prior written permission. Each party's obligations under this section 1.11 will apply during the term of this EULA and for five (5) years following termination of this EULA, provided, however, that (i) obligations with respect to source code will survive forever and (ii) trade secrets will be maintained as such until they fall into the public domain.
1.11.2.	Product Benchmark Results.  You acknowledge that any benchmark results pertaining to the Product are our confidential information and may not be disclosed or published without our prior written consent.
